# 30 Days of LeetCode Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the 30 Days of LeetCode challenge. Each day, I tackle a new coding problem from LeetCode, aiming to improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

- Each day's challenge is organized into its own directory (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.).
- Inside each directory, you'll find:
  - Solution: My solutions are in Java.

## Why This Repository?

- Learning and Improvement: By committing to solving a problem daily, I aim to enhance my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Sharing Knowledge: I believe in sharing my solutions to help others learn and compare different approaches.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these solutions as a reference in your own journey of mastering LeetCode challenges
